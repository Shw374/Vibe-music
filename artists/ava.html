		<h4 >About Artist</h4>
Crafting pop anthems with a much-needed dose of fiery female empowerment, Ava Max is a unique new talent, blessed with a seismic voice, an individualistic high fashion mindset, and an undeniable knack for cinematic, theatrical popcraft. The daughter of Albanian immigrants, Max was born in Wisconsin but raised in Virginia where she began blowing away audiences long before even entering high school. Determined from a young age to grace the stage and equipped with a vibrant voice passed down by her opera singer mother, Max honed her skills performing at multiple singing competitions. Inspired by her parentsâ€™ courageous escape from the political turmoil that plagued their home country; she eventually made the move to Los Angeles to pursue her calling.
